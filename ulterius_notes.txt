Some notes on programming with Ulterius:

isDataAvailable() does not tell you whether there are frames waiting to be sent by callback. It appears to tell you whether there are frames in the Cine buffer.

Synchronization signal is started/ended by toggleFreeze(). Signals will be sent even if not data is being sent to the callback, i.e. setDataToAcquire(0) has been called.
